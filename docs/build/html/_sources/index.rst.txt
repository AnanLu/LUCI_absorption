LUCI is a general purpose fitting pipeline built specifically with SITELLE IFU
data cubes in mind; however, if you need to fit any emission line spectra, LUCI
will be able to help!


Please note that this documentation is not exhaustive. If you have any questions or
wish to see any new implementation, please send a message to carter.rhea@umontreal.ca.
