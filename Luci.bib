	abstract = {We present an overview of {SITELLE}, an Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer ({iFTS}) available at the 3.6-meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. {SITELLE} is a Michelson-type interferometer able to reconstruct the spectrum of every light source within its 11 ﬁeld of view in ﬁlter-selected bands of the visible (350 to 900 nm). The spectral resolution can be adjusted up to R = 10 000 and the spatial resolution is seeinglimited and sampled at 0.32 per pixel. We describe the design of the instrument as well as the data reduction and analysis process. To illustrate {SITELLE}’s capabilities, we present some of the data obtained during and since the August 2015 commissioning run. In particular, we demonstrate its ability to separate the components of the [{OII}] λλ 3726,29 doublet in Orion and to reach R = 9500 around Hα; to detect diﬀuse emission at a level of 4 × 10−17 erg cm−2 s−1 arcsec−2; to obtain integrated spectra of stellar absorption lines in galaxies despite the well-known multiplex disadvantage of the {iFTS}; and to detect emission-line galaxies at diﬀerent redshifts.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the kinematics of {NGC} 6720 is performed on the commissioning data obtained with {SITELLE}, the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope’s new imaging Fourier transform spectrometer. In order to measure carefully the small broadening eﬀect of a shell expansion on an unresolved emission line, we have determined a computationally robust implementation of the convolution of a Gaussian with a sinc instrumental line shape which avoids arithmetic overﬂows. This model can be used to measure line broadening of typically a few km s−1 even at low spectral resolution (R less than 5000). We have also designed the corresponding set of Gaussian apodizing functions that are now used by {ORBS}, the {SITELLE}’s reduction pipeline. We have implemented this model in {ORCS}, a ﬁtting engine for {SITELLE}’s data, and used it to derive the [S ii] density map of the central part of the nebula. The study of the broadening of the [N ii] lines shows that the Main Ring and the Central Lobe are two diﬀerent shells with diﬀerent expansion velocities. We have also derived deep and spatially resolved velocity maps of the Halo in [N ii] and Hα and found that the brightest bubbles are originating from two bipolar structures with a velocity diﬀerence of more than 35 km s−1 lying at the poles of a possibly unique Halo shell expanding at a velocity of more than 15 km s−1.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the host properties of 85224 emission-line galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and {LINERs} form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite {AGN}-{HII} galaxies, Seyferts and {LINERs} and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. {LINERs} are older, more massive, less dusty and more concentrated, and have higher velocity dispersions and lower [{OIII}] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies. We consider the quantity L[{OIII}]/sigma{\textasciicircum}4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[{OIII}]/sigma{\textasciicircum}4, all differences between Seyfert and {LINER} host properties disappear. {LINERs} and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with {LINERs} dominant at low L/L({EDD}) and Seyferts dominant at high L/L({EDD}). These results suggest that the majority of {LINERs} are {AGN} and that the Seyfert/{LINER} dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state transition for X-ray binary systems. We apply theoretical photoionization models and show that pure {LINERs} require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.},

Even if it has been designed to work with both outputs of the Michelson interferometer, up to now only one output has been used. Here we present {ORBS} (Outils de Réduction Binoculaire pour {SpIOMM}/{SITELLE}), the reduction software we designed in order to take advantage of the two output data. {ORBS} will also be used to reduce the data of {SITELLE} (Spectromètre-Imageur pour l' Étude en Long et en Large des raies d' Émissions) \{ the direct successor of {SpIOMM}, which will be in operation at the Canada-France- Hawaii Telescope ({CFHT}) in early 2013. {SITELLE} will deliver larger data cubes than {SpIOMM} (up to 2 cubes of 34 Go each). We thus have made a strong effort in optimizing its performance efficiency in terms of speed and memory usage in order to ensure the best compliance with the quality characteristics discussed with the {CFHT} team. As a result {ORBS} is now capable of reducing 68 Go of data in less than 20 hours using only 5 Go of random-access memory ({RAM}).},

The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional {MCMC} sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \${\textbackslash}sim N{\textasciicircum}2\$ for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and {API}. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple {CPU} cores without extra effort.
